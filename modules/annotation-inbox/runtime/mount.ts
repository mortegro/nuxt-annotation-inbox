/**
 * The annotation toolbar — apparatus for the *developer*, not the reader, and
 * the one mount both harnesses use.
 *
 * A human clicks an element, writes a comment, and the note is mirrored to the
 * dev server, which writes it into `.data/annotations/`. An agent reads the
 * file. See this layer's `README.md`.
 *
 * **One file for two harnesses.** Nuxt reaches it through a plugin the layer's
 * module registers *only* under `nuxt dev`
 * (`../index.ts`); Storybook imports it from its `preview.ts`. Nothing in an
 * app's scanned source refers to it, so sharing it costs no reference in the
 * shipped plugin graph — which is exactly what used to force a Nuxt copy and a
 * Storybook copy to exist side by side.
 *
 * **Every harness gets its own session.** The library keys its store by
 * origin, so notes made on `http://localhost:6011` are a different session
 * from `http://localhost:3040`'s — and, downstream of that, a different file.
 *
 * **`vite-plugin-vue-tracer/client/record` is imported here, not registered.**
 * The tracer plugin (Nuxt DevTools registers it; Storybook's `viteFinal` names
 * it) instruments SFC templates at transform time and records positions into a
 * `globalThis.__vue_tracer__` singleton. Reading that store is a separate
 * module instance, and it does not matter: the singleton is on the global, so
 * the copy resolved here sees exactly what the plugin recorded.
 *
 * **Licence.** `agentation-vue` is [PolyForm Shield
 * 1.0.0](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/shield/1.0.0/) — not an open
 * source licence: it permits any use except building a competing product.
 * That is acceptable for a tool that only ever runs on a developer's machine
 * and would not be for anything shipped, which is why this file is reachable
 * only from a dev server and why the rule is held by a test
 * (this layer's `test/locks.spec.ts`) rather than by habit.

  /*
   * Never in a built preview.
   *
   * This is the build-time half of the rule, and the only thing that keeps the
   * toolbar out of `storybook-static/`: Vite substitutes `import.meta.env.DEV`
   * with the literal `true` under `storybook dev` and `false` under
   * `storybook build`, so in a build everything below becomes unreachable and
   * Rollup drops the four dynamic `import()` calls with their chunks. Under
   * Nuxt the guard is belt to the module's braces — a production build never
   * registers the plugin that imports this file at all.
   *
   * It has to come first for that to happen. The probes below it are runtime
   * questions — they decide whether a toolbar *should appear* in an
   * environment that is already a dev build, a Vitest runner being one — and a
   * runtime question in front would leave the imports reachable for anything
   * static analysis can see. That is measurable, not theoretical: before this
   * guard, `storybook:build` emitted an `assets/agentation-*.js` chunk.

   *
   *  - A story gate that imports `.storybook/preview.ts` and mounts composed
   *    stories under happy-dom. The toolbar reads `sessionStorage` as it
   *    evaluates, which is why the imports below are dynamic and inside this
   *    function rather than at the top of the file; this guard is the second
   *    lock on that door, the first being that `preview.ts` calls this only
   *    from `setup()`, a hook no Vitest mount path runs.
   *  - A browser-mode project rendering each story in a real Chromium, where
   *    everything here would work — and a fixed toolbar in the corner of a
   *    page whose play functions click through it is an overlay no story asked
   *    for.
   *
   * Each announces itself on the global. `happyDOM` is happy-dom's own control
   * handle (`window.happyDOM.waitUntilComplete()`), which Vitest's environment
   * copies onto `globalThis` with the rest of its window; `__vitest_browser__`
   * is the flag `@vitest/browser` sets in the tester frame before a test file
   * loads. Neither exists in the Chromium a developer drives.
   *
   * Not a capability probe, deliberately: happy-dom 20.12 implements
   * `Element.prototype.attachShadow` *and* `Element.prototype.animate`, so
   * "does this DOM do shadow roots" answers yes and proves nothing. What an
   * emulation cannot hide is the handle its runner steers it by.

   * while the toolbar's own reset is written with `:where()` and carries
   * (0,0,0). Unshielded, the host's reset simply outguns it and strips the

   * page nothing: no production stylesheet has to learn that this tool
   * exists.
