 *
 * Two halves of one feature that never share a module graph — one is bundled
 * into the page, the other runs in a server process — and the only thing tying
 * them together is a route string, a storage mount and the shape of one JSON
 * body. Written down once so a rename cannot break the pair silently: a
 * drifting route is a `404` nobody looks at, and a drifting payload shape is a
 * note with a missing field.
 *
 * Neither this file nor `vite.ts` may name `agentation-vue`. The toolbar's
 * dependency is allowed on exactly one file in this package,
 * `runtime/mount.ts`, and the layer's own `test/locks.spec.ts` holds that
 * rule; the types below are the *inbox's* view of an annotation, not the
 * library's: every field the store carries, and nothing that would make a
 * server module import a PolyForm Shield package.

 * the component and leaves the `.vue` file to `@vitejs/plugin-vue`, which
 * resolves its relative imports on its own. The result is two live copies of

 * mount's dynamic import hands back, and the component's, which is the one
 * actually rendering. Hooks set on the first are silently ignored — measured:
 * annotations kept the library's default component chain and never reached
