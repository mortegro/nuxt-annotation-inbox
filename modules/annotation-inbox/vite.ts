/**
 * The inbox's server half under a dev server: a Vite middleware that turns a
 * node request into the transport-neutral request `inbox.ts` answers.
 *
 * **Why a Vite plugin and not only a Nitro route.** The same endpoint has to
 * exist under `nuxt dev` and under `storybook dev`, and the only thing those
 * two harnesses have in common is Vite. Storybook has no Nitro at all, and a
 * second implementation for it is the drift `contract.ts` exists to prevent —
 * so the decisions live in `inbox.ts` and this file is an adapter: request in,
 * response out, no storage layout and no route table of its own.
 *
 * **`apply: 'serve'` no longer means "never ships".** The endpoint half is
 * dev-only because a built Storybook is static files with no server to answer.
 * The *toolbar* now does ship — lazily, behind a runtime access check — and
 * `runtime/mount.ts` holds that end of the rule.
