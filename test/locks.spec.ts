/**
 * This package puts a toolbar in front of a reviewer, and the toolbar is a
 * third-party component under a licence that makes *how* it reaches a browser
 * the thing worth guarding. That is a rule, and a rule nobody can break by
 * accident is a rule a test states.
 *
 * `agentation-vue` is PolyForm Shield 1.0.0 — not an open-source licence, and
 * not one a project installing this layer wants to be distributing under. It
 * used to be kept out of every build outright. It no longer is: annotating a
 * deployed preview is the point of this package, so the toolbar ships — but
 * only ever as a chunk of its own, fetched after the server has said this
 * reader may annotate. A reader who may not never downloads it.
 *
 * That is a weaker guarantee than "absent", and it holds only while the code
 * keeps a precise shape. A single static `import … from 'agentation-vue'`
 * collapses it: a top-level import is part of the module graph before any
 * branch runs, so the library lands in the entry chunk and every reader
 * downloads it whatever the gate answers. There is no runtime symptom — the
 * toolbar still appears only for those allowed in, and the only visible trace
 * is a bigger bundle nobody measures.
 *
 * So the locks that make the layer safe to install live with the layer:
 *
 * 1. Exactly one file in the package names the package at all — the shared
 *    mount, which Nuxt reaches through a plugin and Storybook imports from its
 *    `preview.ts`. Asserted as an equality, not a subset: a second importer is
 *    the failure the rule is about.
 * 2. That mount reaches the package only through dynamic `import()`, and the
 *    access gate stands *before* the first of them — so in a build nothing of
 *    the library is fetched until the server has answered.
 * 3. The package is *this layer's* dependency. A layer another project
 *    installs has to install what it uses, so the entry lives in this
 *    directory's `package.json`; whether the consuming root manifest stays
 *    clean is the consumer's own gate to keep.
 *
 * Read as text off disk rather than through the bundler: the property being
 * asserted is what the source *says*, and the only way to ask the bundler
 * instead would be to build a consuming app and inspect its chunks — a
 * several-minute gate for a rule that is three string searches.
